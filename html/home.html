        The project mainly aims at making the parents well informed about their wards or students hostel leave 
        activities and outing. The system mandatorily informs the parents about their students weekend holidays in 
        prior and if accepted by parents alone it is been processed further to the concerned faculty or faculty. 
        In our Hostel Leave Management System we use a messaging system (voice calls) i.e., every parent of 
        each and every student staying in hostels is informed about his weekend holiday details and asked for 
        confirmation. The parents decision is been processed to the Hostel Leave Management System and is only 
        visible to the warden, when the student applies for leave using his unique user ID and password it is also 
        processed to the Hostel Leave Management System.<br>
        In the Hostel Leave Management System warden has powers to both approve the leave request and also to
        reject leave in case for a valid reason. The warden only approves the students leave request if accepted by the 
        parents and if not he simply rejects it. In the Hostel Leave Management System the student is notified 
        whether his leave request is been accepted or rejected for that weekend once the warden clicks there. If 
        accepted an digitalized leave Approval Form containing the individuals Name, Register Number, 
        Department Name, Wardens Name, Room Number, Leave starting date and time, Leave ending date and 
        time, Reason for leave, Approval status, Place going to visit. If not just a rejection notification is sent to the 
        concerned student by their wardens. Once the student  goes to the main gate he can show his/her id cards and 
        leave the university. As the parents are informed in prior the probability of student security is increased 
        and parents know their wards leave details and arrival. Once known to parents the students will not be able to 
        go anywhere without informing.
